                            I currently am in my 3rd year studying informatics
                            at the <a href="https://inf.ed.ac.uk/">Univeristy of Edinburgh</a>

                        <h4>tech</h4>
                        <p>
                            I do tech for student theatre productions, musicals, band nights and
                            any other kind of event that needs sound, lights or that sort of thing
                        </p>
                        <h4>creative</h4>
                        <p>
                            An absolute aside, but I do enjoy design, 3D, photography and electronic
                            music production. Maybe one day I can spend some more time over here.

                        <p>
                            I love infrastructure of any form, and tend to spend my time working on random
                            network engineering projects. I'm probably more Windows than 'NIX at the moment,
                            having spent plenty of time wrangling with Active Directory, but I'm also very 
                            at home in MacOS (my laptop) or Ubuntu. I also do a fair bit of web app development, 
                            covering the "full stack", with my current weapons of choice being Docker,
                            Django and Bootstrap.

                            I am employed as a member of the <strong>Edinbrugh University Students' Association</strong>'s "Ents" Crew, working
                            as a technician for events including anything
                            from film screenings, to musicals, from band nights to club nights. I've worked with some pretty
                            nice gear, including the Yamaha QL series mixers, ETC Eos and Avolites Titan family lighting consoles.

                            I've worked within the SOC of a large UK ISP for a couple of summers, have experience managing and
                            supporting a small school network and front line IT support. I've also spent a summer on the software
                            development team of an education SaaS company.

                            I'm on the committee for <strong><a href="https://freshair.org.uk">FreshAir.org.uk</a>, Edinburgh's student
                            radio station</strong> as an assistant technician. That means I look after the broadcasting setup within our
                            studio, and occasionally help out with the website and server management. We're currently working 
                            to completely refit the entire studio with new kit, as we're limping along on some fairly obsolete 
                            gear.

                            I was on the term-time committee of the <strong>Edinburgh University Theatre Company's <a href="https://www.bedlamtheatre.co.uk">Bedlam Theatre</a></strong> as their
                            venue technical manager. I worked closely with the venue manager and the Students' Association estates team
                            to keep the building up and running, and maintained the AV kit in the building. I also worked with their Fringe
                            team last summer to implement and support a new ticketing system, provided by <a href="https://red61.com">Red61</a>.
