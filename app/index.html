                            Working with some of the best talent in Edinburgh, I have experience planning events, constructing 
                            rigs, programming and operating lights, sound and projection for everything from experimental theatre 
                            productions to full-blown musicals in a number of venues. I work best with ETC Eos, Avolites Titan, 
                            Qlab and Yamaha QL. I also have extensive experience configuring and managing ticketing and point of 
                            sale systems, including Red61 VIA.

                            system commissioning systems and containerised application platforms, I can help get networks working
                            for your clients, whether you are a Windows, Linux or MacOS based organisation. I'm also able to 
                            develop bespoke web-apps to build a solution to nearly any problem.
