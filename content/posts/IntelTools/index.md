IntelTools was developed as a toolkit to pull together data useful in research for emerging cyber threats from 
multiple sources. Features were implemented based off of requests and feedback from user testing by Security 
Analysts.

Features included:

 - Fully containerised deployments
 - Caching of data to minimise repeated requests
 - Tracking of data changes for an endpoint
 - Logging of search queries for audit and to identify endpoints multiple analysts are working on
 - Lazy/asynchronous loading of each "panel" of data
 - Fully responsive Bootstrap UI
 - PasteBin clone
