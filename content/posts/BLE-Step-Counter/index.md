This was a coursework project as part of my [Principles and Design of IoT course](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/19-20/dpt/cxinfr11150.htm) at the University of Edinburgh.

The project involved working with data from both a Bluetooth Low Energy device which was capable of streaming sensor
data to a mobile device, identifying the best way to process this data through use of tools such as Numpy and
Jupyter notebook, implementing a counter algorithm and then porting this to an embedded hardware platform (NRF52) 
and creating a companion Android app to read the data out of the device.

This was very much a full-stack application, working with everything from raw sensor data, Python data manipulation 
and analysis, C++ development and app development on Android.

The writeup for this proect is available [here](PDIoT.pdf).
