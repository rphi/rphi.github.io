WingMan was designed to work using an Arduino and C#.NET companion app to translate the state of physical buttons
and faders into OSC (Open Sound Control) format commands which can be fed into applications such as ETC's Eos 
lighting control system.

This was developed as an alternative to the (very expensive) hardware control "wings" provided by first-parties
such as ETC to improve the programming experience when using ETC's Nomad PC based control software.

There is a microsite and docs for WingMan available on GitHub pages at [rphi.uk/WingMan](https://rphi.uk/WingMan/)
