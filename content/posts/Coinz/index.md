Coinz was written as a coursework project as part of the Informatics Large Practical course during my 
batchelor's degree at the University of Edinburgh.

I won't deny this is a fairly rudimentary piece of software, but given it was my first real foray into 
Android development (and had to be rewritten from scratch half way through), it was a functional
game will all the core features implemented by the time it was submitted.

There's a full writeup of the app on its repo:
