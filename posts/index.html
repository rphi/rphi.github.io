Backups were to be file-level and make use of delta syncs, and the system was designed to be resilient and able to operate over conventional, low-grade WAN links using HTTPS to simplify deployment....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer><span title="2020-04-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">April 24, 2020</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2 min</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to CoStor - peer-to-peer distributed backup" href=https://rphi.uk/posts/costor/></a></article><article class=post-entry><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src="https://github.com/rphi/IoTSSC/blob/master/report/webapp-1.png?raw=true" alt></figure><header class=entry-header><h2>AirSense - personal air quality monitor</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>Another joint university project, AirSense was a hardware and software solution built as part of my coursework for the Internet of Things, Security and Cloud course at the University of Edinburgh.
